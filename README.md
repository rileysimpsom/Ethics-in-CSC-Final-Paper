# Autonomous Vehicles: Navigating the Ethical Crossroads

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the research paper **"Autonomous Vehicles: Navigating the Ethical Crossroads"**, which examines the ethical and legal dilemmas posed by autonomous vehicles (AVs). The paper discusses the complex decision-making algorithms required in AVs and explores how these decisions impact societal and individual safety.

## Abstract
The rapid adoption of autonomous vehicles has introduced numerous ethical and legal challenges, particularly concerning decision-making in life-threatening situations. This paper explores two primary ethical frameworks:
- **Deontology**: Focused on the sanctity of individual human life, advocating for rigid ethical rules in AV decision-making.
- **Utilitarianism**: Prioritizing the greatest good for the majority, often at the potential expense of a few.

Key considerations include liability issues, public perception, and regulatory frameworks. The research advocates for a synchronized ethical and legal structure to ensure the safe and equitable integration of AVs into society.

## Key Highlights
- Analysis of ethical frameworks (Deontology vs. Utilitarianism) in AV decision-making.
- Exploration of the **legal implications** of AV algorithms and their integration into current laws.
- Discussion of the societal impact of AVs, including public perception and potential job displacement.
- Advocacy for rigorous ethical standards and public dialogue to navigate the integration of AVs into daily life.

## Research Topics
- Ethical Decision-Making in Autonomous Vehicles
- Legal Challenges of AV Integration
- Public Perception and Societal Impact
- Regulatory Frameworks for AV Development
